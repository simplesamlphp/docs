Holds the scripts to build the documentation website (not the docs themselves).

The main website is versioned in [simplesamlphp.github.io](https://github.com/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp.github.io). This repository is published
at https://simplesamlphp.org/docs.

To improve the contents of the docs themselves, please refer to the
[`docs` directory in the main repository](https://github.com/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp/tree/master/docs) or to the `docs` directory in the relevant
module.
